# Pokémon ML: Who's That Pokémon?

Pokémon has been a significant part of my life—from trading cards with classmates in elementary school to competing in TCG tournaments, playing the video games on emulators, and watching the anime on television. As a longtime fan, I’ve followed this iconic Japanese franchise since childhood. 

However, as I’ve grown older, my interactions with Pokémon have become less frequent. Now, as a college student studying **Statistics and Machine Learning** at **Carnegie Mellon University**, I’ve been learning various machine learning concepts through my coursework. This project is an opportunity to merge my passion for Pokémon with my knowledge of machine learning.

The inspiration behind this project comes from a classic segment in the Pokémon anime:  
### **"Who’s That Pokémon?"**

In these moments, right before a commercial break, the screen would silhouette a Pokémon and challenge the viewer to identify it.

As a kid, I would always yell the answer at the screen—though the show usually made it obvious by introducing the Pokémon just moments before.

But what if it wasn’t obvious?  
What if the only thing you had was the image of the Pokémon itself?  
Could you still tell which one it is?

I have split this project into two different problems. The first problem showcases
my understanding of ML. The second problem shows how I am able to apply models 
in the real world. 

1. Classifying a Pokémon as a legendary or non-legendary:

    According to the Pokémon Wikipedia page, Legendary Pokémon are described as:

    “A group of incredibly rare and often very powerful Pokémon. They are often 
    featured prominently in the legends and myths of the Pokémon world, with 
    some even going so far as to view them as deities … No explicit criteria 
    define what makes a Pokémon a Legendary Pokémon. Instead, the only way to 
    identify a Pokémon as belonging to this group is through statements from 
    official media, such as the games or animation.”

2. Classifying a Pokémon's primary type out of the 18 Pokémon types:
    Grass, Fire, Water, Bug, Normal, Poison, Electric, Ground, 
    Fairy, Fighting, Psychic, Rock, Ghost, Ice, Dragon, Dark, 
    Steel, Flying.
